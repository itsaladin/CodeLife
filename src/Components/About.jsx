                        <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>

                        <p>I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>

                        <p>In this world, everything can be happy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.</p>

                        <p>Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. With practice comes confidence. Get tough with it, get strong. It's all a game of angles.</p>
